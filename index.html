    <h> About Me</h>
    <p> My name is Vicente Mejia and I'm a senior at S.T.E.M Early College High School. As of right now my major is liberal arts, but I want to switch to Mechanical Engineering. I will be attending Texas A&M Kingsville in the Fall of 2018. I would like to participate in Robotics and Soccer while I attend there. 
I enjoy playing soccer, building, and robotics. I am also interested in Materials Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Forensic Science. I hope to double major get a minor in different fields of study. After Kingsville, I would like to attend College Station to get my Masters.</p>
